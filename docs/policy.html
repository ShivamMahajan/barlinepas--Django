<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Protecting your private information is our priority.</h3>
<p>This Statement of Privacy applies to the barlinepass.com and BarLinePass and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to BarLinePass include barlinepass.com and BLP. The BLP website is a Ecommerce site. By using the BLP website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>

<h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>BLP may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by BLP. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the BLP website.</p>
<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>BLP collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.</p>
<p>BLP may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from BLP and its affiliates. BLP may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
 <p>BLP does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>
<p>BLP may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is transferred to the third party. BLP may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to BLP, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
 </p>
<p>BLP may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within BLP, in order to determine what BLP services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within BLP to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<p>
BLP will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BLP or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BLP; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BLP, or the public.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>The BLP website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize BLP pages, or register with BLP site or services, a cookie helps BLP to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same BLP website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the BLP features that you customized.</p>
<p>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the BLP services or websites you visit.</p>
<p>

<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>

<p>
BLP secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
</p>
